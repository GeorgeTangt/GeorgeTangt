# 👋 Hi, I'm George Tang
### Cloud Security Engineer | AWS | Threat Detection | Automation | Compliance

I design and build secure, resilient cloud security architectures using AWS, Terraform, automation, and real-time detection engineering.  
My work focuses on enterprise-grade security controls, multi-account environments, and hands-on incident response in the cloud.
